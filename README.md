# TEXT-SUMMERIZATION
Automatic Text summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content.

In addition to text, images and videos can also be summarized. Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document;[1] various methods of image summarization are the subject of ongoing research, with some looking to display the most representative images from a given collection or generating a video;[2][3][4] video summarization extracts the most important frames from the video content
